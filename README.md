# wynnManaCalc

WynnManaCalc is an extension for https://wynnbuilder.github.io/builder. This extension will automatically calculate your net mana gain/loss

The mana cost is automatically grabbed from wynnbuilder thus:
Radiance works ✅ 
Shaman mask works ✅ 

What doesn't work yet:
Manastorm ❌
Transcendence ❌

I am planning on making those work soon.
